# Dotfiles

My humble dotfiles.

I have two computers:

  - picard, a custom-built desktop running Ubuntu 20.04
  - troi, a thinkpad x220 laptop running Ubuntu 20.04

These scripts help me keep them in sync as well as serving as a general record
of changes etc

## How to use

When first setting up a machine, simply run:

```
git clone git@github.com:thereforsunrise/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/checkin.sh
```
